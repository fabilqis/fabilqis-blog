From early years, I had thought to "rather than I do nothing, let's register myself to become college student.

To be inform, I have one son and small family but my son also will be a kindergarten child in next half year, and we are not planning to add one.

Life feel too easy, without things that I'll do in certain time.

I already graduated from diploma degree, but I despair I don't have any courage to use my knowledge in electronics to professional career.
My GPA not really bad, but since graduated I never looking related job, but I change my path to become a software developer (and failed).
Then I move to bigger company to be SME trainer in electronics but in reality the chance was never come.
Because my supervisor think that I am best in managing data.
Sooner I really forget what's going on with electronics career and move to Human Resources Management.

Sigh, without any backround in HR fields, I literally survived.

And I want to pursuit this career seriously.

Now, after 6 months looking for campus and subject.

I am registered as Bachelor of Management student in Open Indonesia University (Flexible-Online classes, a state university and cheap to pay).
Expecting 3 years of survive and voila "Fadillah Bilqis A.Md.T S.M"
Isn't it funny?

Welcome, and I still have a dream to pursue my master in Waseda University, tho.


## Things

  * Create learing lessons because managing time is crucial.
  * Just do what you can do, ganbatte!
  * My older version must be envious with my newest version.
